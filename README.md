# Vehicle-Dataset-Analysis
An analysis on the factors that contribute to the selling price of pre-owned vehicles.

## Introduction:
This repository holds an analysis that aims to investigate how the selling price of a pre-owned vehicle is determined based on various factors such as the year of the model, the name of the vehicle, its current market value, fuel type, and transmission to name a few. This analysis begins with a short Exploratory Data Analysis that briefly explores the data and its contents, followed by a quick clean-up and preprocessing to transform the data and fit it to a Linear Regression model.

## Project Overview
This analysis combines data visualisation, exploration, and machine learning to observe patterns in the selling price of pre-owned vehicles. The analysis observes the relationship between the features that affect the selling price, to what extent, and assumptions made based on domain and common knowledge. This project includes a statistical element where correlations are observed and inferences based on the results are made.

## Repository Contents
* A single Jupyter Notebook file
* "cars.csv" Dataset
* ReadME.md

## Collaborations
Feel free to explore the analysis and challenge the findings that were made. While the dataset is a limited sample, many other findings and observations can be made. Any and all contributions to the analysis are welcome.
